\section VRIntro Introduction to VR Support in CGV Framework

The VR support distributed over several libraries and plugins. 
The following list gives a brief overview:

- \dr{cgv/libs/vr}

  basic interface to implement vr apps that is independent of cgv framework and specific
  vr api. It builds on the concept of a driver that provides instances of vr kits and
  supports calibration through a calibration matrix. There
  can be several drivers in use at the same time. A simple registry is used to manage 
  drivers and vr kits. The vr_kit class provides access to the display and the controllers
  with a simple state polling api.

- \dr{cgv/3rd/openvr}

  a copy of the openvr library such that it compiles within the build system of the framework.
  There is one change to support compilation with unicode characters under windows.

- \dr{cgv/plugins/openvr_driver}

  implements the vr interface for the openvr api. The only thing that needs to be done is to 
  add the \c openvr_driver plugin as dependent project in the .pj-file.

  Currently, under windows steam vr changes the framebuffer type to non sRGB. Then the gamma correction
  needs to be set to 1.0f with cgv::render::context::set_gamma(1.0f) instead of the standard value of 2.2f. 
  As this happens even if no vr device is attached. 
  
  One can define the option <tt>CGV_OPTIONS=NO_OPENVR</tt> when one
  is not using a vr kit. Then openvr is not initialized by the openvr driver.

- \dr{cgv/test/vr}
  
  Plugin that implements a vr driver emulating one or several vr kits that can be controlled with keyboard.
  More information on its usage can be found in \ref VREmul.

- \dr{cgv/plugins/cg_vr}

  This plugin connects \dr{cgv/libs/vr} to \dr{cgv/gui} by translating changes in the
  vr kit states into events dispatched though the cgv::gui::event_handler interface.
  The central class for this is cgv::gui::vr_server. Please see its documentation.
  VR events are declared in the cgv/plugins/cg_vr/vr_events.h header and marked with 
  the cgv::gui::EF_VR event flag.
  
- \dr{cgv/plugins/crg_vr_view}

  This plugin extends the stereo_view_interactor class of the crg_stereo_view plugin with
  vr support to the vr_view_interactor class. It connects to the on_device_change 
  signal of the cgv::gui::vr_server singelton and keeps track of device changes in order 
  to initialize and destruct their framebuffers in the opengl context of the vr_view_interactor.
  
  It keeps a current vr_kit which can be selected with \sc{Ctrl-Alt-0..3} or through the 
  user interface. It can render vr kits with meshes and or with spheres 
  representing eyes and controllers. If the meshes are not provided in the \c CGV_DATA path
  and in Debug configuration the sphere rendering is the default.
  
  Furthermore, the action zone boundaries can be rendered
  as a dashed fence. It can also debug all emitted vr events in the text console window.
  The vr_view_interactor manages its own view which can be controlled with the mouse as in the
  case of the stereo_view_interactor. 
  
  Further rendering passes are issued to render from the
  views of the hmds of the present vr kits. The current vr kit states are queried with
  `pose_query=2` for the currently selected vr kit and with `pose_query=1` for the others.
  The rendered vr views are submitted to the hmds and can optionally blit in the current 
  framebuffer. The queried states are dispatched in the cgv::gui::vr_server singleton with the
  cgv::gui::vr_server::check_new_state() function such that you should use the second or third option descripted in
  the detailed documentation of the cgv::gui::vr_server.

  The vr_view_interactor provides the following configuration methods:
  - vr_view_interactor::set_event_type_flags() ... to specify which events should be
    sent to the event handles. By default all events are sent.
  - vr_view_interactor::enable_vr_event_debugging() ... allows to toggle debugging of vr events
  - and several rendering configuration methods as documented in the vr_view_interactor class

  All vr events provide information on the state of the vr_kit that generated the event. 
  Further convenience functions that can be called also during the draw process are
  - vr_view_interactor::get_current_vr_state() ... access to the vr_state of the active vr_kit
  - vr_view_interactor::get_view_dir_of_kit(), vr_view_interactor::get_view_up_dir_of_kit(), vr_view_interactor::get_eye_of_kit() ... to access the view information of the attached vr_kits
  
- \dr{cgv/plugins/vr_test}

  an advanced example of how to use the vr in the cgv framework that includes picking and
  grabbing of boxes through controller rays and a touch of the controller touchpad, offline text rendering
  to display an information board and rendering a polygonal mesh (currently the file name is hard coded and
  needs to be changed in the code to some local meshes)

\section VRCalib Calibration of Tracking System

Each vr driver has an optional 3x4 matrix to transform all tracked poses. The transformation can
be enabled with vr::vr_driver::enable_calibration_transformation() and disabled with 
vr::vr_driver::enable_calibration_transformation(). One can query the current transformation
matrix with vr::vr_driver::put_calibration_transformation(). Setting the calibration matrix
is restricted to classes derived from vr::vr_calibration_base. 

Typically, one does not deal with the calibration matrix directly, but uses the functionality
implemented in vr_view_interactor. To define the calibration matrix in a way that the 
coordinates of the tracking system align with the physical world, one follows the following
procedure:
-# find a point on a horizontal surface in physical space (table or ground) which has a 
   corresponding point in your virtual scene
-# place a controller upside on the horizontal surface pointing in a direction aligned 
   with a physical edge that corresponds to a virtual edge.
-# single click corresponding point in your virtual scene, such that the focus point of
   vr_view_interactor is set to the clicked point
-# press \sc{Shift-Ctrl-0..3} with the number key corresponding to the controller index 
   (you can also use a tracker for calibration). Then vr_view_interactor sets its calibration
   location vectors and update and enable the calibration matrix of the current vr driver such 
   that tracked position of the calibrated controller matches the position of the focus point
   in the virtual scene
-# to adjust the rotation go to the \mn{vr interactor} tab and open the \mn{VR calibration} UI 
   node. Adjust the \mn{tracking_rotation} slider to match the 2D rotation of the virtual
   controller and the physical controller. The vr_view_interactor always updates the driver
   calibration matrix when this rotation angle is changed.
-# When you are done with calibration, you can save the calibration to a file by pressing
   the save icon of \mn{calibration_file_path}. Please choose `.cal` as extension.

To automatically read your calibration at program start add the following line to your
<tt>.pj</tt>-file:

    type(vr_view_interactor):calibration_file_path="D:/develop/table.cal"

\section VREmul Emulation of Virtual VR Kits

When you add the plugin \dr{cgv/test/vr/vr_emulator.pj} to the list of dependent projects in your `.pj`-file:

    addProjectDeps = [ ... , "vr_emulator", ... ];
    addProjectDirs = [ ... , CGV_DIR."/test/vr", ... ];

the plugin automatically creates an instance of the \c vr_emulator class that generates a new tabgroup 
in the UI and handles keyboard shortcuts. You can configure
the \c vr_emulator instance in your configuration file. See 
<tt>cgv/test/vr/config.def</tt> for a documented
list of possible configurations, which include creation of vr kits at program start.

After program start you can create a new vr_kit with the shortcut \sc{Ctrl-Alt-N}.

Each vr_kit is controlled by a very simple model of the human body that can move and turn,
bend the hip forward/backward, turn the head left or right (yaw) and move each hand in a local
3D coordinate system with origin in the corresponding shoulder and oriented as the hip 
coordinate system.

To control the body model the vr_emulator allows to use the keys \sc{0}, \sc{1}, \sc{2}, and \sc{3} as 
modifier keys to control up to 4 vr_kits with the keyboard. The arrow keys allow to move and
rotate. \sc{PgUp} and \sc{PgDn} control hip bending and \sc{Home} and \sc{End} yawing.

The controller keys of each kit are can be toggled with the following keys pressed while
holding the modifier key (\sc{0 .. 3}) of the vr kit:

- \sc{Q} ... left menu
- \sc{A} ... left button 0
- \sc{W} ... left button 1
- \sc{D} ... left button 2
- \sc{X} ... left button 3
- \sc{C} ... left touch
- \sc{S} ... left press
- \sc{O} ... right menu
- \sc{L} ... right button 0
- \sc{I} ... right button 1
- \sc{J} ... right button 2
- \sc{M} ... right button 3
- \sc{K} ... right touch
- \sc{N} ... right press

To make sure that all keys are dispatched by `vr_emulator`, select it for keyboard focus
with the tab key or by selecting its tab group.
